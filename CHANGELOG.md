# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - unreleased

> Not yet tagged. `release.yml` fires on `v*.*.*` tags only, and its final step
> runs `git tag -fa v0 && git push origin v0 --force` — the `v0` major tag is
> force-moved to whatever was tagged last. Consumers who want the current
> behaviour should pin `AISquare-Studio/AISquare-Studio-QA@v0`, which always
> resolves to the newest 0.x release; pin `@v0.3.0` only to freeze.

### Fixed

- **Playwright browser launch failures (`BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist`).**
  `requirements.txt` declared a bare, unversioned `playwright`, so the pip package
  floated to whatever was newest on the runner while the cached browser build in
  `~/.cache/ms-playwright` could be arbitrarily older. Pinned `playwright==1.54.0`,
  the version the code is developed against (only `playwright.sync_api` symbols are
  used: `sync_playwright`, `Page`, `TimeoutError`).
- **Stale Playwright browser cache silently satisfying the cache check.** The
  browser cache in `action.yml` was keyed on `hashFiles('.autoqa-action/requirements.txt')`
  — a constant, because nothing in that file was pinned — and carried the wildcard
  restore-key `${{ runner.os }}-playwright-`. Any prior cache entry from any
  Playwright version would restore, `steps.playwright-cache.outputs.cache-hit`
  would report `true`, and the `playwright install chromium` step (guarded by
  `if: cache-hit != 'true'`) would be skipped — leaving no browser binary on disk.
  Removed all restore-keys (exact-match only) and rotated the key suffix to `-v3`
  to invalidate every poisoned entry. Applied the same fix to both Playwright
  cache steps in `.github/workflows/test-action.yml`, which share the same path.
- **`test-self-autoqa` failing on every fork and Dependabot PR.** The job consumes
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `STAGING_URL`, `STAGING_EMAIL` and `STAGING_PASSWORD`, which
  GitHub deliberately withholds from fork PRs and from Dependabot, so the job could
  only ever go red there (e.g. #43). Added a job-level guard that skips it for
  fork-originated and Dependabot PRs while leaving `push` and `workflow_dispatch`
  runs untouched. The trigger stays `pull_request`: this repository is public with
  forks, and `pull_request_target` would execute fork-controlled code with those
  secrets in scope.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — repository custom instructions file for GitHub Copilot, providing architecture reference, file layout, CI/CD, configuration, linting, testing, security model, and a mandatory session checklist so that AI agents can work without redundant codebase exploration
- Enhancement roadmap (`docs/AUTOQA_ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md`) with 16 feature proposals inspired by Lucent AI and Meticulous AI, organized into 4 implementation phases targeting reduced human intervention and tighter QA coverage
- Proposal 16: AI-Generated PR Test Criteria — AutoQA analyzes code diffs and generates test criteria for developer review, eliminating the need for developers to manually write test steps in PR descriptions
- `TestCriteriaGenerator` module (`src/autoqa/criteria_generator.py`) implementing Proposal 16: auto-generates test criteria from PR diffs using LLM, posts suggestions as PR comments, supports approval via reaction/comment/label, tier inference from file paths, and auto-proceed for high-confidence criteria
- `auto-criteria` execution mode in `action.yml` and `action_runner.py` for automated criteria generation workflow
- Auto-criteria configuration section in `config/autoqa_config.yaml` with mode, threshold, approval mechanism, and tier inference settings
- New action inputs: `auto-criteria-fallback`, `auto-criteria-mode`, `auto-criteria-threshold`, `auto-criteria-approval`
- New action outputs: `auto_criteria_results`, `criteria`
- Comprehensive test suite for `TestCriteriaGenerator` with 51 unit tests (`tests/test_criteria_generator.py`)

### Changed

- Migrated agent instructions from root `INSTRUCTIONS.md` to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` per GitHub repository custom instructions best practices — GitHub Copilot now reads these instructions automatically
- Updated `README.md` contributing section to reference `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### Removed

- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` — replaced by `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### Fixed

- Updated deprecated `actions/checkout@v4` to `@v6` in `action.yml`, examples, and docs — resolves CI failures caused by Node.js 20 deprecation on GitHub Actions runners
- Updated `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to `@v7` in examples and docs for consistency with `action.yml`
- Aligned all action version references in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (`actions/cache@v3`→`@v5`, `actions/setup-python@v4`→`@v6`)
- Fixed upstream repo checkout failure caused by `github.action_ref` resolving to `v6` (from `actions/checkout@v6` step ref) inside the composite action instead of the composite action's own invocation ref — removed unreliable `github.action_ref` from the checkout ref fallback chain and changed `action-ref` input default to `main`

### Fixed

- Fixed release workflow test to use correct parser API (`extract_autoqa_block`)
- Fixed release workflow flake8 flag from `--ignore` to `--extend-ignore` for consistency
