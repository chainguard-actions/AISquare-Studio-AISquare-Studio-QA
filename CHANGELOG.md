## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — repository custom instructions file for GitHub Copilot, providing architecture reference, file layout, CI/CD, configuration, linting, testing, security model, and a mandatory session checklist so that AI agents can work without redundant codebase exploration
- Enhancement roadmap (`docs/AUTOQA_ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md`) with 16 feature proposals inspired by Lucent AI and Meticulous AI, organized into 4 implementation phases targeting reduced human intervention and tighter QA coverage
- Proposal 16: AI-Generated PR Test Criteria — AutoQA analyzes code diffs and generates test criteria for developer review, eliminating the need for developers to manually write test steps in PR descriptions
- `TestCriteriaGenerator` module (`src/autoqa/criteria_generator.py`) implementing Proposal 16: auto-generates test criteria from PR diffs using LLM, posts suggestions as PR comments, supports approval via reaction/comment/label, tier inference from file paths, and auto-proceed for high-confidence criteria
- `auto-criteria` execution mode in `action.yml` and `action_runner.py` for automated criteria generation workflow
- Auto-criteria configuration section in `config/autoqa_config.yaml` with mode, threshold, approval mechanism, and tier inference settings
- New action inputs: `auto-criteria-fallback`, `auto-criteria-mode`, `auto-criteria-threshold`, `auto-criteria-approval`
- New action outputs: `auto_criteria_results`, `criteria`
- Comprehensive test suite for `TestCriteriaGenerator` with 51 unit tests (`tests/test_criteria_generator.py`)

### Changed

- Migrated agent instructions from root `INSTRUCTIONS.md` to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` per GitHub repository custom instructions best practices — GitHub Copilot now reads these instructions automatically
- Updated `README.md` contributing section to reference `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### Removed

- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` — replaced by `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### Fixed

- Updated deprecated `actions/checkout@v4` to `@v6` in `action.yml`, examples, and docs — resolves CI failures caused by Node.js 20 deprecation on GitHub Actions runners
- Updated `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to `@v7` in examples and docs for consistency with `action.yml`
- Aligned all action version references in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (`actions/cache@v3`→`@v5`, `actions/setup-python@v4`→`@v6`)
- Fixed upstream repo checkout failure caused by `github.action_ref` resolving to `v6` (from `actions/checkout@v6` step ref) inside the composite action instead of the composite action's own invocation ref — removed unreliable `github.action_ref` from the checkout ref fallback chain and changed `action-ref` input default to `main`

### Fixed

- Fixed release workflow test to use correct parser API (`extract_autoqa_block`)
- Fixed release workflow flake8 flag from `--ignore` to `--extend-ignore` for consistency
